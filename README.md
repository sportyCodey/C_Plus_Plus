Some of my work in C++

Before I get into the details, here's a quick run down of each folder posted:

The code I've done in C++: Code

A simple console game I created: Games

I took Programming 1 in C++ (at a different school than my current one), but that's it. So, after programming 1 concepts, I am 100% self-taught in C++. Programming 1 concepts usually cover the basics of programming and end with arrays and functions. So, I taught myself all the object oriented programming concepts, the namespace concept, pointers, and structs in C++. I can see those being the programming 2 concepts in a college class. However, I'm still not done learning C++. I need to learn the syntax for data structures and exception handling. Also, there must be more advanced topics out there. Soon it'll be time to purchase another C++ textbook that teaches advanced topics. Learning C++ wasn't too hard because of my experience in C.

I don't have many programs to display here in C++. Mainly, it's because I'm more interested in Java, C#, and C. Also, my university does not teach C++, so I couldn't spent a lot of time with C++ inside the classroom. However, the software presented are problems I worked in my self-study (mostly programming 2 concepts) to get comfortable with C++ syntax, improve programming skills in general, and show I know object oriented programming in C++. There are a few basic programming 1 problems just to show that I can do those as well. These programs solve problems taken from the textbook C++ Programming From Problem Analysis to Program Design 7th Editin by Malik.

These programs are in no particular order. Please note, some header files have the extension hpp and some have the extension h. This is becuase I do some coding in Microsoft Visual Studio and some in Xcode by Apple.
