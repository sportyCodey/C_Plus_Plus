Some of my work in C++


I took Programming 1 in C++, but that's it. So, after programming 1 concepts, I am 100% self-taught in C++. Programming 1 concepts usually
cover the basics and end with arrays and functions. So, I taught myself all the object oriented programming concepts, the namespace concept, pointers, and structs in C++. I can see those being the programming 2 concepts in a college class. However, I'm still not done learning C++. I need to learn the syntax for data structures and exception handling. Also, there must be more advanced topics out there. Soon it'll be time for another C++ textbook that teaches advanced topics. Learning C++ wasn't too hard because of my experience in C.

I don't have many programs to display here in C++. Mainly because I spent too much time in the theory and not much time practicing. Also, I'm more interested in Java and C#. However, the software presented are problems I worked on to improve programming skill in general, get comfortable with syntax, and show I know object oriented programming in C++. These are programs solve problems taken from a textbook.
